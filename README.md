# image two generator
this was mostly designed for use to make easy drafts for dumb sticky art stuff. This is not a tool to finalize one of those crappy sticky note art stuff, 
And it didn't work at all, but i think this was funny as fuck, so I shall call it the image two generator Replace yourimage.png with your own png file, please and thank you

Config file settings explained
Width and Height = the desired height and width of your image
